2. Update version in `package.json`
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`

   vsce publish patch
   ```

## Testing Before Publishing

### Local Installation
```bash
code --install-extension crowe-lang-0.2.0.vsix
```

### Test Checklist
- [ ] Syntax highlighting works for .crowe files
- [ ] IntelliSense provides completions
- [ ] Compilation commands work
- [ ] Language server starts without errors
- [ ] No console errors in Extension Host

## Marketplace Listing Optimization

### Keywords
Ensure `package.json` includes relevant keywords:
- crowe
- react
- jsx
- typescript
- ai
- state-management
- language-server

### README
The extension README.md becomes the marketplace description. Include:
- Clear feature list with checkmarks
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Installation instructions
- Links to documentation

### Icon
Add a 128x128 PNG icon:
1. Create icon as `icon.png` in extension root
2. Update `package.json`:
   ```json
   "icon": "icon.png"
   ```

### Gallery Banner
Already configured in `package.json`:
```json
"galleryBanner": {
  "color": "#007acc",
  "theme": "dark"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Publisher not found"**
   - Ensure publisher ID matches exactly
   - Wait a few minutes after creating publisher

2. **"Invalid extension package"**
   - Check all required fields in package.json
   - Ensure no syntax errors in JSON files
   - Verify file paths are correct

3. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Regenerate PAT with correct scopes
   - Ensure PAT hasn't expired
   - Try logging out and back in: `vsce logout` then `vsce login`

## Automated Publishing (CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:

```yaml
name: Publish VS Code Extension

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd vscode-extension
          npm install
          npm install -g @vscode/vsce
          
      - name: Compile extension
        run: |
          cd vscode-extension
          npm run compile
          
      - name: Publish to Marketplace
        env:
          VSCE_PAT: ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
        run: |
          cd vscode-extension
          vsce publish -p $VSCE_PAT
```
