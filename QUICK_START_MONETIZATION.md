Subject: Reduce React development time by 40% with Crowe Language

Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company}} has been growing their React team. Most teams using React struggle with:
- Complex state management
- Slow development cycles
- Inconsistent code patterns

Crowe Language solves these with:
âœ¨ AI-powered development assistance
âš¡ 10x faster compilation than TypeScript
ðŸ”„ Built-in state management

Companies like {{similarCompany}} reduced development time by 40% after adopting Crowe.

Worth a 15-minute demo to see if it's a fit for {{company}}?

Best,
Michael

    if (aiResponse.confidence > 0.8) {
      return this.sendAutomatedResponse(ticket, aiResponse);
    }
    
    // Route to human
    const priority = this.calculatePriority(ticket);
    return this.assignToAgent(ticket, priority);

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Pricing too low** - Start higher, can always lower
2. **Feature creep** - Stay focused on core value
3. **Ignoring churn** - Track why customers leave
4. **Slow support** - Response time kills trust
5. **Over-promising** - Under-promise, over-deliver

### Contingency Plans
- If MRR < $1K after 60 days: Pivot pricing model
- If churn > 10%: Focus on product-market fit
- If CAC > $500: Optimize funnel or raise prices
- If enterprise = 0: Hire sales consultant

## Action Items for Tomorrow

1. **Morning (2 hours)**
   - [ ] Set up Stripe account
   - [ ] Create pricing page
   - [ ] Install analytics

2. **Afternoon (3 hours)**
   - [ ] Write first blog post
   - [ ] Set up email list
   - [ ] Create demo video

3. **Evening (1 hour)**
   - [ ] Post on Twitter
   - [ ] Share in Discord
   - [ ] Email 10 contacts

Remember: **Start small, iterate fast, listen to customers!**

The goal is not perfection, it's learning what customers will pay for. Ship the MVP, get feedback, and improve continuously.

**Your first dollar is the hardest. After that, it's just multiplication.** ðŸ’ª
